# Dependencies, modules, and IDEs

This installs my dev environment and some other stuff, b/c i'm lazy.

Execution:

```zsh
./macos.sh
./shell.sh
./ssh.sh
./brew.sh
./direnv.sh
./git.sh
./tmux.sh
./python.sh
./node.sh
./rust.sh
./ruby.sh
./neovim.sh
./vscode.sh
```
Some scripts require you to reinitialize your shell session to update path, env vars, etc. It is recommended to execute the scripts step by step for this reason.
